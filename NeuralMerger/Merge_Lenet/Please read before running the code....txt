From Haoyang

The pytorch code is in 'main_model_pytorch' and can be run directly

Data and weights are not uploaded due to the large file size.

Before running the code, please do the following:

1. go to Experiment1 (the folder from the author), go to Merge_Lenet,
go to Calibration_stage, copy 'data' and 'PQ_weight', paste these
2 files to folder 'Calibration_stage' which I uploaded.

2. go to config.py, change weight_dir and max_iter    

Please let me know if you still have issue running the code after
completing the 2 steps above.
